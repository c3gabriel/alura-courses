# Practice code log

This repository is meant to store , among other things, my codelines throught learning of new techs and frameworks! The courses developed by Alura can be bundled in modules or can be consumed cherry-picked courses in the plataform.

## Naming conventions

Alura has its material mainly produced in portuguese, so the folders containing the source will be named in portuguese and its modules will have the prefix `formacao` while the courses will be named directly without any prefix.
